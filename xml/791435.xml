  <Comment user="kuhlmanna" audience="Internal" date="2023-02-06">Added the labels Prostate and Uterus</Comment><Comment user="yousufzaimg" audience="Internal" date="2023-01-30">Highlighted the lymph nodes in the female figure on the R side so they are similar to the male version; moved the label b) to the L side of both figures so that it creates a bit more space for the labels; and moved the lymph node metastases near the common iliac artery to the L side of the figures</Comment><Comment user="yousufzaimg" audience="Internal" date="2023-01-17">Diversity updates: Changed image to a two-panel image and added a stage IIIB female figure (as the right panel); updated skin tone for both figures to FP III or IV to represent Hispanic/Latino; centered the title above the two panels</Comment><Comment audience="Internal" date="2018-03-01" user="kuhlmanna">Removed the cancer that is outside the bladder and not in a lymph node per expert reviewer</Comment><Comment audience="Internal" date="2018-01-09" user="yousufzaimg">Added brackets on each side of the common iliac arteries, going from where they join the main artery at the top to where they branch into the external iliac arteries at the bottom (right where the ureter crosses the blood vessels).</Comment><Comment audience="Internal" date="2017-12-11" user="kuhlmanna">Removed the small a) at the bottom of figure; made the Cancer label point to the cancer spot on the bladder; removed the label “Layer of fat around the bladder"; changed label for Common iliac artery to plural; for a), took the cancer out of the lymph nodes on the red artery and just kept it in the nodes on the blue artery and near the ureter; and made all of the cancer-negative nodes less “shiny”.  </Comment><Comment audience="Internal" date="2017-11-27" user="kuhlmanna">First draft, per AJCC updates (8th edition)</Comment></OriginalSource>
