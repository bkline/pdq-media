   <ContentDescription audience="Patients" language="en">Stage IIIB lung cancer (2); drawing shows a primary tumor in the left lung and (a) a separate tumor in a different lobe of the lung with the primary tumor. Also shown is cancer in lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the primary tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are around the trachea or where the trachea divides into the bronchi. Also shown is (b) cancer that has spread to the following: the chest wall and the lining of the chest wall and lung, the nerve that controls the voice box, the trachea, the carina, the esophagus, the breastbone, the diaphragm, the nerve that controls the diaphragm, the aorta and vena cava, the heart, and the sac around the heart.</ContentDescription>
