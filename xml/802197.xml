   <ContentDescription audience="Patients" language="en">Drawing showing an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern between a father,  mother, and their children. The panel on the left shows an affected father (who only has one X chromosome) with a mutated (changed) gene on the X chromosome; an unaffected mother (who has two X chromosomes) with a normal gene on both X chromosomes; an affected daughter (who has two X chromosomes) with a mutated gene on one X chromosome and a normal gene on the other X chromosome; and an unaffected son (who only has one X chromosome) with a normal gene on the X chromosome. The panel on the right shows an unaffected father with a normal gene on the X chromosome; an affected mother with a normal gene on one X chromosome and a mutated gene on the other X chromosome; an unaffected daughter with a normal gene on both X chromosomes; an unaffected son with a normal gene on the X chromosome; an affected daughter with a mutated gene on one X chromosome and a normal gene on the other X chromosome; and an affected son with a mutated gene on the X chromosome.</ContentDescription><ContentDescription audience="Health_professionals" language="en">Drawing showing an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern between a father,  mother, and their children.

   <MediaCaption audience="Patients" language="en">X-linked dominant inheritance is a way a genetic trait or condition can be passed down from parent to child through mutations (changes) in a gene on a single X chromosome. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in a gene on one of the X chromosomes is enough to cause the condition. In males (who only have one X chromosome), a mutation in the copy of the gene on the single X chromosome causes the condition. Fathers cannot pass X-linked dominant conditions to their sons, but all daughters of affected fathers will be affected with the condition and can pass it on to their children.</MediaCaption><MediaCaption audience="Health_professionals" language="en">X-linked dominant inheritance is a way a genetic trait or condition can be passed down from parent to child through mutations (changes) in a gene on a single X chromosome.
