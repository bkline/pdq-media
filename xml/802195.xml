   <MediaCaption audience="Patients" language="en">Autosomal recessive inheritance is a way a genetic trait or condition can be passed down from parent to child. A genetic condition can occur when the child inherits one copy of a mutated (changed) gene from each parent. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive condition usually do not have the condition. Unaffected parents are called carriers because they each carry one copy of the mutated gene and can pass it to their children.</MediaCaption><MediaCaption audience="Health_professionals" language="en">Autosomal recessive inheritance is a way a genetic trait or condition can be passed down from parent to child.
